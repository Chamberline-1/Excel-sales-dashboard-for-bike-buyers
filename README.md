# Excel-sales-dashboard-for-bike-buyers

# Introduction 
This project possess a dataset containing various demographic and behavioral attributes for individual customers, including customer ID, marital status, income, commute distance, age bracket, and a crucial indicator of whether each customer purchased a bicycle. The challenge lies in extracting actionable insights from this raw data to identify key customer segments that are most likely to purchase a bike, as well as understanding the factors that influence purchasing decisions.

This project aims to address this challenge by developing an interactive Excel sales dashboard. This dashboard will serve as a powerful analytical tool, enabling the client to visualize sales trends, identify correlations between customer attributes and purchase behavior, and ultimately make data-driven decisions

# Key Metrics
1. No of bike purchasers and non purchasers
2. Average income of bike purchasers and non bike purchasers
3. Customer count by marital status
4. Customer count by income
5. Customer count by commute distance
6. Customer count by age brackets
7. Top bike purchasers by age brackets and region

# Skills used 
- Data preparation and cleaning like removing duplicates and creating a new column
- Excel functions like IF Statements, pivot tables, slicers and pivot charts
- Data analysis and interpretation
- Dashboard design

# Analysis
1. Bike Purchase Rate:
A clear distinction was found between bike purchasers and non-purchasers, providing a baseline for further segmentation.
3. Income and Purchase Behavior:
Higher income brackets were more likely to purchase bikes, indicating a strong correlation between disposable income and purchasing power.
4. Marital Status Trends:
Married individuals had a higher likelihood of purchasing bikes, possibly due to lifestyle needs (e.g., family activities, commuting).
5. Commute Distance:
Customers with shorter commute distances (e.g., under 5 miles) showed higher purchase rates, suggesting bikes are often used for short-distance commuting.
6. Age Bracket Insights:
Certain age brackets, particularly younger and middle-aged groups, were more active in purchasing, reflecting a health-conscious or eco-conscious demographic.
7. Regional Performance:
When segmented by region, some areas showed significantly higher bike purchase volumes, providing potential geographic opportunities for targeted marketing.

# Concluson
This Dashboard for Bike Buyers successfully transformed a raw dataset into an insightful and interactive analytical tool. By leveraging Excel's capabilities such as pivot tables, slicers, IF statements, and data visualization, the project provided a clear view of the key factors influencing bike purchases.

The analysis revealed strong correlations between purchasing behavior and specific customer attributes particularly income level, commute distance, age group, and marital status. It also highlighted valuable geographic trends that can inform regional marketing strategies.
From a business perspective, the dashboard serves as a decision-support tool that empowers stakeholders to:
1. Monitor bike sales performance across various demographic segments
2. Understand customer behavior patterns
3. Identify high-potential markets and customer profiles

The project demonstrates how even simple tools like Excel can deliver significant analytical value when used effectively, especially for small to mid-sized organizations or marketing teams looking for low-cost, high-impact solutions.
