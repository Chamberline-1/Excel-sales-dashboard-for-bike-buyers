# Introduction 
This project possess a dataset containing various demographic and behavioral attributes for individual customers, including customer ID, marital status, income, commute distance, age bracket, and a crucial indicator of whether each customer purchased a bicycle. The challenge lies in extracting actionable insights from this raw data to identify key customer segments that are most likely to purchase a bike, as well as understanding the factors that influence purchasing decisions.
